## About The Project


The Movie Management System is a web application designed for fetching movies, directors, and actors from an API through an RSS parser. It also provides the functionality to manage this movie data using a SQL database, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on movies, and export the database into XML format. The system supports two roles: User and Admin.


## Clone the project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LukaLjubic/Java-RSS-Parser.git

## SQL Instalation
Within the repository, you'll find an SQL script tailored for this project. To create the project's database, please follow these steps in Microsoft SQL Management Studio:

1. Run SQL Script: Open a new query window in Microsoft SQL Management Studio and execute the SQL script provided in the repository. This script will set up the necessary database structure and initial data.

2. Configuration: Keep in mind that your database connection details may differ initially. Therefore, within the project source code, locate the section containing SQL Database constants. Adjust these constants to match your database configuration for seamless integration.
